AN!SCS; Safe Cluster Shutdown

Author  - Madison Kelly (aka Digimer)
Version - Pre-release

This program is designed to be placed in /etc/rc.d/rc6.d/K00an-scs to ensure it
runs prior to any component of the cluster shuts down.

It's job is to safely migrate, or if not possible, shut down any running VMs.
This script is needed because, on AN!Clusters, there are two rgmanager service
types in parallel; Storage and the VMs themselves. When the rgmanager daemon is
told to stop, it tries to stop parallel services at the same time. This can 
cause problems because the storage fails to stop when the VMs are still 
running.

This program checks the VM's definition file for defined block devices. For 
each block device found, a check is made to see what DRBD resources are used. 
It then ensures that the peer's disk state and role are UpToDate and Primary,
respectively. If they are, the VM is migrated to the peer. If for any reason
these checks fail, the VM is gracefully shutdown.

The program assumes the following;

- Cluster running RHCS stable 3 (cman + corosync + rgmanager)
- DRBD 8.3.x is used to back LVM.
- Clustered LVM with LVs backing VMs.
- KVM-based hypervisor (others may work)
- VM managed by 'virsh' from 'libvirtd'.

Specifically, this program was designed for:
